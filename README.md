ImmuMethy, a database of DNA methylation plasticity and homeostasis in human blood and immune cells. 

The Perl script 'methylation_profile.pl' is used to calculate methylation profile across multiple samples within a study dataset.

The Perl script 'betavalue2matrix.pl' is used to create a matrix file containing normalized beta values.

The file 'scripts.beta.values.R' includes some command line statements for beta value calculation by using the package 'minfi'.

The file 'fivenum-mean.R' is used to return Tukeyâ€™s five-number summary of input data [i.e., minimum value, lower-hinge value (Q1), median value (Q2), upper-hinge value (Q3), maximum value], the mean of beta values, and MPL score for each methylation site.
